# Setting Up PHP behind Nginx with FastCGI 
The traditional way of running PHP is with Apache HTTP Server using mod\_php. In fact, mod\_php was the most popular Apache module up until 2009 when that claim went to mod_ssl. But as the Internet grew and the technologies that power it evolved, other ways of serving PHP sites and applications became available. nginx, a server written to solve the C10k problem, is eating into Apache’s marketshare, and running PHP behind nginx with FastCGI is becoming an increasingly commonplace alternative.

CGI defines the environment (environment variables, request-specific variables, etc.) a script will execute in, and how data is passed between the script and the web server. For each request, CGI sets up the environment, spawns a running instance of the script and passes any incoming data to it, and captures and sends the script’s output to the server.

### configuration in php.ini 
Find `cgi.fix_pathinfo`, uncomment the setting and set this value = 1. The default value is 0.

### configuration in nginx.conf

### configuration in fastcgi_params

You can also find some information from [here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/phpfcgi/), but note: I need to commented this line to let everything worked fine. However I saw this in almost every post I read about Nginx configs, so it bothered me. 
```

fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;

fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        $fastcgi_script_name;
fastcgi_param  PATH_INFO          $fastcgi_path_info;
#fastcgi_param  PATH_TRANSLATED    $document_root$fastcgi_path_info;
fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;
fastcgi_param  HTTPS              $https if_not_empty;

fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx/$nginx_version;

fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;

# PHP only, required if PHP was built with --enable-force-cgi-redirect
fastcgi_param  REDIRECT_STATUS    200;

```
