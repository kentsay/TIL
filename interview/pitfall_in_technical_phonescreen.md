This is some note I took from [Mastering the Software Engineering Interview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview/home/welcome) on Coursera. It's about some pitfall you should try to avoid during your technical phone interview. 

* Unconfirmed assumptions
  * Start by talking through potential issues and asking clarifly questions
  * example: I want to go through some examples to make sure that I understand the question correctly
  * Ask some edge case becuase most of the time the problem they want you to solve is not that hard becuase of the time
  * Write the example you find out by documenting them above your code to show your communication skill and detail in documentation

* Lack of communication (silence)
  * Talk through your though process when coding a technical question. The interviewer want to hear your thought process!
  * Keep talking and think out loud

* Missed errors and failure to correct them
  * Find and recover from mistakes
  * React in a professional and knowledge way when you make mistake
  * Remeber: the interviewer want you to success, so don't ignore their hint

* Lack of follow through and analysis
  * Explain your thought and logic, let other know how did you get here
  * Explain the complexity of your code and analysis your solution
